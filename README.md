# Fetpype
The *fetpype* organization is centered, as its name indicates, around the development of *fetpype*, 
a pipeline to run fetal brain MRI analysis pipelines in a consistent, reproducible way. It aims to facilitate the integration and inter-operation
of many existing processing pipelines for super-resolution reconstruction, segmentation, etc.
